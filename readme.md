# Co-Op Tetris

Play Tetris collaboratively with your friends!

1. `cd server`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
1. Open [localhost:1111](http://localhost:1111) in a browser

To play with friends remotely, you can forward port 1111 by a service like ``localtunnel``:

```
npm install -g localtunnel
npx localtunnel --port 1111
```

Then you'll get a URL to share for people to join your game.
